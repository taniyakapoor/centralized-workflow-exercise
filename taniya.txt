cooking is fun. 

One pot dishes are a staple for those busy weekdays in our lives. This one pot shrimp and rice is quick cooking, perfectly flavorful, and clean up is a breeze.

The rice is infused with chicken broth and garlic for a boost in flavor, and the shrimp is upgraded with that classic lemon butter combo to really highlight it.

It’s a simple process that takes minimal effort but yields an impressive finished result that will please everyone.

If you are wondering what to make with shrimp and rice I’d suggest serving with buttery cooked broccoli, asparagus or peas to finish it off. It can really benefit from a nice fresh pop of green to compliment it.

You can’t go wrong with this simple dinner!
